*Bug Fixes:*
 - Maybe that Google SSO code 10 error. I was too lazy to test it myself.

*Features*
 - More regular updates! I added remoteConfig to control the update regularity. This way if I get more users I can control the slider myself to prevent hitting the server too hard.

I spent most of the time on this release on the automatic deployment. It should hopefully save my hours in the future.

Also, these release notes were written in a text file, not on Google Play. Let's see if it works.
